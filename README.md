# Spatial Analytics - Spring 2021
This is my personal repository with code and data related to the Spring 2021 module _Spatial Analytics_ as part of the bachelor's tilvalg in [Cultural Data Science](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis. 

## Technicalities
Each week I will upload my answers to the given assignment. These can be found in the folder, _src_, along with a description of how to run them. 

To run scripts within this repository, I recommend cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frillecode/CDS-spring-2021-spatial.git
cd CDS-spring-2021-spatial
```


## Repo structure

This repository has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```W1```| A folder with files connected to the assignment for week 1
```W2```| A folder with files connected to the assignment for week 2
